- Comprehensive analytics and reporting
- User-friendly dashboards for all roles

### üîê Secure Authentication
- Firebase Authentication integration
- Role-based access control
- Admin email verification system
- Secure data storage with Firestore

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
- **AI/ML**: Cloudinary AI, Custom classification algorithms
- **UI/UX**: Lucide React Icons, React Hot Toast
- **Deployment**: Ready for Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project
- Cloudinary account

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd resolve360
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   - Create a new Firebase project
   - Enable Authentication, Firestore, and Storage
   - Update `src/firebase/config.js` with your Firebase credentials:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "your-project-id",
     storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
   };
   ```

4. **Configure Cloudinary**
   - Create a Cloudinary account
   - Update `src/cloudinary/config.js` with your credentials:
   ```javascript
   export const cloudinaryConfig = {
     cloudName: 'YOUR_CLOUD_NAME',
     uploadPreset: 'YOUR_UPLOAD_PRESET',
     apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
     apiSecret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET'
   };
   ```

5. **Set up Firestore Security Rules**
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // Users can read/write their own data
       match /users/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
       
       // Issues can be read by authenticated users, written by users
       match /issues/{issueId} {
         allow read: if request.auth != null;
         allow write: if request.auth != null;
       }
       
       // Admins collection for admin verification
       match /admins/{adminEmail} {
         allow read: if request.auth != null;
         allow write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
